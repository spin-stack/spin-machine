# The device set QEMU is built with, passed as `--with-devices-x86_64=spin`.
#
# This file was byte-for-byte the same list in spinbox (build/qemu/devices.mak) and in
# storage (hack/qemu-devices.mak) — the comments differed, every CONFIG_ line agreed — and
# this is now the only copy. A device set is part of what a machine *is*: two of them is
# two machines that a template cannot be moved between, silently.
#
# A file and not a `sed`/`echo >>` over the source tree, because that tree lives in a
# BuildKit cache mount keyed by version alone: an edit made there survives every later
# build, including ones meant to undo it, and — worse — it is applied inside the
# `if [ ! -f config.status ]` branch, so whether the tree being compiled is the tree
# upstream shipped depends on whether some earlier build happened to configure. This file
# is copied in and read on every build.
#
# **One device per function, and the function's most compatible device.** For a Linux guest
# that is virtio without qualification: in mainline since 2.6.25 and in every distribution's
# kernel. e1000 and rtl8139 are "more compatible" only for a guest with no virtio drivers,
# which is not what this runs. Every extra model is a device a guest could be given by
# accident, a driver its kernel has to carry, and for a NIC an option ROM QEMU refuses to
# start without.
#
# What the VM actually gets is in spinbox's internal/host/vm/qemu/qemu_command.go, and it
# is all virtio: virtio-blk-pci, virtio-net-pci, virtio-rng-pci, vhost-vsock-pci and virtconsole,
# on a q35 started with -nodefaults. Everything below follows from that one list.
#
# Only symbols upstream marks optional are touched — the ones carrying
# `default y if PCI_DEVICES` (or ISA/PCIE/USB) in hw/*/Kconfig. Nothing `select`s them, so
# each goes on its own and PCI_DEVICES itself stays. Turning off a symbol upstream does not
# offer produces a link failure twenty minutes in, at `make`, which configure cannot warn
# about; every change here is checked by running scripts/minikconf.py against this file
# before a build is started.

# --- no display, no sound, no USB, no serial over PCI -------------------------------------

# guests have no devices on.
#
# CONFIG_VGA_PCI stays, and it is the one entry here that a build had to find: upstream
# offers it, minikconf accepts turning it off, and then `make` fails twenty minutes later
# with `undefined reference to pci_std_vga_mmio_region_init` — hw/display/virtio-vga.c
# calls into vga-pci.c, and virtio-vga is not a symbol upstream offers at this level. The

# Two that upstream's default.mak offers and 11.1.1 refuses, each found by running
# scripts/minikconf.py rather than by reading the list:
#   CONFIG_SGA=n  — "undefined symbol SGA": the device is gone from the Kconfig tree and
#                   the line survives in upstream's default.mak alone.
#   CONFIG_FDC=n  — "contradiction between clauses when setting FDC": q35's ICH9 brings an
#                   ISA_SUPERIO, which selects FDC_ISA, which selects FDC.
# and a third that only `make` can find, recorded at CONFIG_VGA_PCI above.
#
# And one this build used to set and no longer does: CONFIG_CXL=n. Upstream does not offer
# it, and turning it off broke the 11.0.2 link (ACPI and the PCI expander bridge still
# reference cxl_component_register_block_init). It was appended to the source tree's
# default.mak from inside the "only if not configured yet" branch, so whether it applied at
# all depended on whether the build cache happened to be cold.
#
# Deliberately left on:
#   PCI_DEVICES  — q35 references controllers this would take with it, and every model
#                  above is reachable one at a time without it.
#   PCI_BRIDGE, PCIE_PORT, XIO3130, IOH3420, I82801B11 — a q35's root ports.
#   VIRTIO_PCI, VIRTIO_BLK, VIRTIO_NET, VIRTIO_RNG, VIRTIO_SERIAL, VHOST_VSOCK,
#   VIRTIO_BALLOON, VIRTIO_MEM, DIMM — the devices this VM is actually given, plus the
#   memory hotplug path (spinbox's internal/shim/memhotplug).
#   VIRTIO_SCSI — kept for a caller that wants more disks than a q35 has PCI slots; it is
#                 storage's reason and it costs one device model.
#   VTD, AMD_IOMMU — VFIO on q35 needs them.
#   HPET, PVPANIC — the machine line says hpet=off, which is a property of the device
#                   being there; pvpanic is how a guest reports a panic.
#   SEV, TDX, SGX — confidential computing is a product decision, not debloat.
